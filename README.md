# 📊 Project Management Power BI Dashboard

current situation of the organization based on the high-level KPIs and data shown in your Power BI dashboard.

🔍 Current Situation Analysis
✅ 1. Strong Financial Impact from Projects
Income Generation: ₹237.93M

Process Improvement: ₹222.23M

Cost Reduction: ₹194.57M

Working Capital Improvement: ₹219.25M

📌 Insight:
These numbers are very healthy, indicating that the strategic projects are generating strong returns, both from new revenue and operational efficiencies. Projects are:

Increasing income,

Reducing operating costs,

Improving cash availability.

✅ 2. High Average Project Completion Rate – 87.01%
Indicates that the majority of projects are being completed successfully or are on track.

Admin & BI (88.17%), Supply Chain (87.92%), and Warehouse (87.48%) all show high execution consistency.

Phase 2 (Develop) completion: 100%, Phase 3 (Plan): 93% – suggests good planning & execution discipline.

📌 Insight:
The project management office (PMO) is effectively tracking timelines and delivering results, especially across key departments.

⚠️ 3. Slight Bottleneck – Project Status Distribution
50 projects ongoing, 30 completed, 17 on hold, 2 cancelled

📌 Insight:
While ongoing and completed project counts are healthy, 17 projects on hold (~17%) is a signal to investigate:

Are these delayed due to resource constraints?

External dependencies? Lack of clarity?

This is where proactive follow-ups and risk management from the JD become critical.

✅ 4. Balanced Resource Allocation (Projects by Manager)
Project load is well-distributed among managers: Most handle 12–18 projects.

No one seems overloaded, suggesting good resource planning.

📌 Insight:
This supports smooth coordination across teams, which aligns with JD requirements like stakeholder coordination and project scheduling.

⚠️ 5. Complexity Mix – Watch the High Complexity Projects
40 High complexity, 29 Medium, 30 Low

📌 Insight:
~40% of projects are high-complexity. That’s substantial.

These likely drive the most value but carry the most risk.

Senior management must ensure adequate monitoring, skilled teams, and risk buffers are in place.

✅ 6. Positive Trend in Cost vs Benefit (Bar Chart)
In most years, project benefits are visibly higher than costs.

Indicates a healthy ROI on strategic initiatives.

📌 Insight:
Confirms that the organization is investing wisely in projects and deriving tangible returns—key for senior leadership confidence.

Recommended Actions for Leadership:

Conduct root cause analysis of on-hold projects

📌 Final Thought for Senior Management:
The portfolio of projects is generating high value and is well-managed overall, but some on-hold projects and high-complexity tasks need focused review to prevent future delivery risks.
